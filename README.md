# Collection-Game
Concept
The core concept of the game involves survival and the focus on the collection of items, as the player races against a timer to complete their objective and must avoid enemies in order to survive. The game is set in a playground where the player must collect their lost toys without being caught by the enemies watching. 

Goal and Description
The playerâ€™s main objective is to collect all of the toys on the level. A challenge is introduced with the given time limit and the enemies constantly following the player, which the player must avoid to survive.

Core Mechanics
A core mechanic of the game is item collection, in which the player must move about the level in order to locate and collect. Another core mechanic is evading enemies, as they could make the player lose when they succeed in chasing.  Additionally, navigating the level quickly would also be a mechanic, given the time limit and the obstacles placed within the game. 

Controls and UI
To control the player, the player can use the WASD keys, or arrow keys, to move left, right, forward, and backward. Players can also choose to jump with the spacebar, speed up with the Left Shift button, and bounce off of specific objects in the game. UI elements include text displaying the game state (win/lose), the score in the top right, the timer in the top left, and the unlock feature on the bottom of the screen.

Levels
Level 1: basic game world with a few enemies, bouncy blocks, and pickups added
